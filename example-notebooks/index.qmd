title: Example Notebooks

To run the notebooks locally, you can use a virtual environment and jupyter.

Make sure to use underscore for the virtual environment so it's not renderd by `quarto render`

```bash
python3 -m venv _env
source _env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=_env
jupyter notebook
```

To execute and render html locally:

```bash
quarto render --execute
open _site/index.html 
```

To preview local changes live, you can use preview, however this will not re-run any code cells:

```bash
quarto preview
```
