title: Usage Examples
---

## Getting started
The example notebooks are divided into three sections: 

- **Quickstarts**: Notebooks to get you started quickly and help you become more familiar with cloud-native geospatial technologies.
- **Tutorials**: Longer notebooks that walk through more advanced use cases and examples.
- **Datasets**: Notebooks that showcase a particular VEDA dataset and walk through an applied geospatial analyses.

## Choosing the right data access route for your needs
The Quickstarts examples are further divided into two sections, which you can choose from depending on your data needs:

- **Accessing the Data Directly**: For when you want to access the raw data (e.g., to do a specific analysis). In this case, permissions are required to access the data (i.e., must be run on VEDA JupyterHub) and computation happens within the user's instance (i.e., the user needs to think about instance size). This approach is suitable for use within notebooks. All examples provided in this section require VEDA JupyterHub access to run. 

- **Using the Raster API**: For when you want to show outputs to other people or do standard processing. No permissions required (i.e., notebooks can be run on `mybinder`). Additionally, the computation happens somehwere else (i.e., user does not have to think about instance size). Lastly, this approach is suitable for use within notebooks as well as web application frontends (e.g., like dataset discoveries). These notebook examples can be run on both VEDA JupyterHub, as well as outside of the Hub (see instructions below) and within `mybinder`.


## How to run

Every notebook contains information about how to run it. Some can run on [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/) and all can run on the VEDA JupyterHub. See [VEDA Analytics JupyterHub Access](https://nasa-impact.github.io/veda-docs/veda-jh-access.html) for information about how to gain access.

### Running outside of VEDA JupyterHub

To run the notebooks locally, you can use a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Use an underscore to prefix your virtual environment so quarto doesn't render any contents of the virtual environment directory.

```bash
python3 -m venv _env
source _env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=_env
jupyter notebook
```

If the notebook needs access to protected data on S3, you will need to specifically get access. Please request access by emailing aimee@developmentseed.org or alexandra@developmentseed.org and providing your affiliation, interest in or expected use of the dataset and an AWS IAM role or user Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

## Contributing to VEDA 

Contribution to VEDA's documentation is always welcome. In order to share your notebook on VEDA's JupyterHub, you'll have to generate a link to allow for that functionality. You can find more details in the instructions below.

### Generate a "Run on VEDA" link

We use [`nbgitpuller`](https://hub.jupyter.org/nbgitpuller/) links to open the VEDA JupyterHub with a particular notebook pulled in. These links have the form: `https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-docs&urlpath=lab/tree/veda-docs/example-notebooks/open-and-plot.ipynb&branch=main`

If you are writing a notebook and want to share it with others you can generate your own `nbgitpuller` link using this
[link generator](https://hub.jupyter.org/nbgitpuller/link?hub=https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud&repo=https://github.com/NASA-impact/veda-docs&branch=main&app=jupyterlab).
