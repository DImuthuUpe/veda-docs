title: Example Notebooks
---

To run the notebooks locally, you can use a python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

Use an underscore to prefix your virtual environment so quarto doesn't render any contents of the virtual environment directory.

```bash
python3 -m venv _env
source _env/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=_env
jupyter notebook
```

To execute the notebooks, render them in html and then view the result locally:

```bash
quarto render --to html
open _site/index.html 
```

To preview local changes live, you can use preview, however this will not re-run any code cells:

```bash
quarto preview
```
