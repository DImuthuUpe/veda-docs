## Welcome {#welcome}

NASA's [Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda) project promotes open science with Earth data, supporting the full circle of science communication and publication, exploration of the scientific methods and statistics behind results, and new cloud-enabled scientific analytics and automated data production.

These pages provide documentation for onboarding users to cloud-enabled open science with Earth data, from computing and API usage to publication on the [VEDA Dashboard](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard).


## Data Services

In VEDA's open-source science environment, datasets can be discovered and accessed via open-standard data services such as a Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC) and WMTS map tiles APIs. Here is an [overview of the API endpoints](./services/apis.qmd). 


## Resources for Open-Source Data Science

If you are just getting started with geospatial data science (in Python) or want to learn more, you may find the [Collection of External Resources](./external-resources.qmd) useful.

To learn from examples, see the [VEDA Example Notebooks](./example-notebooks/index.qmd) - examples of open-source data science using VEDA services.

Selected user groups can also get access to a VEDA-provided [JupyterHub service](./services/jupyterhub.qmd).


## Contributing

Contributions of data, stories, and example code are open to all users affiliated with the project. We strive to make the process as easy as possible. Please see the docs on [Contributing](./contributing/index.qmd).
